"use strict";

let name = 'Bucky';

console.log('My favorite person is '+ name +'because he smells nice');
//an easier way to use variables in strings-using template litrals

console.log(`My favorite person is ${name} becasue he smells good`);

//you can do dis too;

let a =5;
let b = 7;

console.log(`My favorite person is ${a+b} becasue he smells good`);

//with template literal you dont need keywords to specify new line just press enter and put the next sentence like below
console.log(`My favorite person is ${name} because  //pressed enter here
he smells good`);
